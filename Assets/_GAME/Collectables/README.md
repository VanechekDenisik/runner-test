# Collectables system
The system handles the processing of in-game collectables. With this system you can create coins, gems, chests
with different mechanics that can be collected with character during the run. The system is rather simple.

Use [CollectableConfig](Scripts/CollectableConfig.cs) to create collectables with different parameters and bonuses.
Use [Coin base prefab](Prefabs/Coin base.prefab) as base prefab for all in-game collectables using prefab 
variants Unity system.
